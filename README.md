#[Office Supply Sales Analysis]
As part of my learning journey with Dataleum I worked on this project.
The goal of this project was to analyze office supply sales dataset ;
-To give an Executive summary of what's happening in the business in each state , segment and product.
-To determine which products are key performance drivers and also help the business make decisions on which products should be discontinued.
I did my best to give performance reports on products, segments and states.
Made key findings and gave recommendations from concluded insights.
