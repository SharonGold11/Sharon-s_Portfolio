As part of my learning journey with Dataleum I worked on this project.
The goal of this project was to analyze office supply sales dataset ;
1. To give an Executive summary of what's happening in the business in each state , segment and product.
2. To determine which products are key performance drivers and also help the business make decisions on which products should be discontinued.
3. I did my best to give performance reports on products, segments and states.
4. Made key findings and gave recommendations from concluded insights.

Suicide i believe no one is too strong to escape suicidal thoughts except God helps you...
I stumbled on this dataset Kaggle titled suicide rate overview (1985-2020). I profiled, cleaned, modeled, and visualized the data in power BI.
I prepared and cleaned the data using power query via the model view of Power BI.
At the end of my analysis, I designed this dashboard to showcase the insights and specific recommendations that can help reduce the suicide rate in our world.
