This is an Adidas Sales Analysis with the dataset gotten from Kaggle.
The goal was to analyze what was going on with Adidas products distributions between 2020 - 2021.
I analyzed the following using Microsoft Power Bi.
1. Units sold for each product and sales method used.
2. Retailer's unit orders.
3. Revenue and Total cost for each product and sales method used.
4. Revenue and Profit Trend for the duration.

As part of my learning journey with Dataleum I worked on this project.
The goal of this project was to analyze office supply sales dataset ;
1. To give an Executive summary of what's happening in the business in each state , segment and product.
2. To determine which products are key performance drivers and also help the business make decisions on which products should be discontinued.
3. I did my best to give performance reports on products, segments and states.
4. Made key findings and gave recommendations from concluded insights.
