Suicide i believe no one is too strong to escape suicidal thoughts except God helps you... I stumbled on this dataset Kaggle titled suicide rate overview (1985-2020). I profiled, cleaned, modeled, and visualized the data in power BI. I prepared and cleaned the data using power query via the model view of Power BI. At the end of my analysis, I designed this dashboard to showcase the insights and specific recommendations that can help reduce the suicide rate in our world.
